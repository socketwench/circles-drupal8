circles-drupal8
===============

A rewrite and upgrade of Flag Friend for Drupal 8

The goal of the module is to provide a lightweight alternative to OG. Instead of the primacy of the group, circles focuses on the primacy of the user. Like Google+, this module allows users to define their own "circles" and add users to one or more circles. Likewise, users may specify in which circles each piece of content is visible.
